Machine Learning is being used for the analysis of the importance of
clinical parameters and their combinations for prognosis, e.g. prediction
of disease progression, extraction of medical knowledge for outcome
research, therapy planning and support, and for the overall patient
management. But, the research in machine learning methods for
medical applications, to-date remains centred on technological issues
and is mostly application driven. However, in order to answer
fundamental questions and acquire useful insight in the performance
and behaviour of Machine Learning methods in a medical context, it is
important to enhance our understanding of Machine Learning
algorithms.
In todays era, several experiments are conducted on medical data sets
using multiple classifiers and feature selection techniques. Much of the
research on breast cancer datasets can be found in the literature
